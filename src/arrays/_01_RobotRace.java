	//3. use a for loop to initialize the robots.

		//4. make each robot start at the bottom of the screen, side by side, facing up

	//5. use another for loop to iterate through the array and make each robot move 
	//   a random amount less than 50.

	//6. use a while loop to repeat step 5 until a robot has reached the top of the screen.

	//7. declare that robot the winner and throw it a party!

	//8. try different races with different amounts of robots.

	//9. make the robots race around a circular track.
